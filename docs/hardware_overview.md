<figcaption markdown>IoT Motor Driver power connections.</figcaption>
</figure>

Below, is a general summary of the power circuitry on the board:

* **`3V3`** - Provides a regulated 3.3V from the USB (5V) power to the board, excluding the TMC6300 motor driver.
	* Used to power the ESP32-WROOM module, hall-effect and current sensors, CH340C Serial-to-UART bridge, Qwiic connector, and the WS2812 RGB LED.
	* The **3.3V** [AP2112](./assets/component_documentation/AP2112.pdf) LDO regulator can source up to 600mA.
	* Broken out as [PTH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through-hole_technology "Plated Through Holes") pin.
* **`3V3_A`** - Provides a regulated 3.3V from the USB (5V) power to only the TMC6300 motor driver.
	* The motor driver will not function without power from the USB connector.
	* The **3.3V** [AP63357](./assets/component_documentation/AP63356-AP63357.pdf) LDO regulator can source up to 3.5A.
* **`VUSB`** - The voltage from the USB-C connector, usually **5V**.
	* Power source for the entire board.
		* Powers the two 3.3V voltage regulators (AP2112 and AP63357).
	* Features reverse current protection and a thermal fuse.
	* `MEAS` - These pins can be used to measure the current being drawn through the USB connector *(see the **[Jumpers](#jumpers)** section)*.
* **`GND`** - The common ground or the 0V reference for the voltage supplies.
* **Qwiic Connector** - Provides a regulated 3.3V voltage to the Qwiic devices.

!!! info
	For more details, users can reference the [schematic](./assets/board_files/schematic.pdf) and the datasheets of the individual components on the board.

??? warning "Motor Voltage"
	The [Gimbal Stabilizer Motor](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/e/b/2/8/3/OT-EM3215_DC_Brushless_Gimbal_Motor_3_Phase_Datasheet.pdf) has an operating voltage range of 6 - 8V. However, we have found that it still functions properly with only 3.3V provided by the IoT Motor Driver board.


### CH340 Serial-to-UART
The CH340 allows the ESP32-WROOM to communicate with a computer/host device through the board's USB-C connection. This allows the board to show up as a device on the serial (or COM) port of the computer. Users will need to install the latest drivers for the computer to recognize the board *(see [**Software Overview**](/SparkFun_IoT_Brushless_Motor_Driver/software_overview/#ch340-driver) section)*.

#### Pin Functionality
There are several pins that have special functionality in addition to general **digital I/O**. These pins and their additional functions are listed in the tabs below. For more technical specifications on the **I/O** pins, you can refer to the [schematic](./assets/board_files/schematic.pdf), [ESP32-WROOM module datasheet](./assets/component_documentation/esp32-wroom-32e_datasheet_en.pdf), [ESP32 SoC datasheet](./assets/component_documentation/esp32_soc_datasheet_en.pdf), and [documentation for the ESP32 Arduino core](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/tutorials/io_mux.html?#peripherals).


=== "Digital I/O Pins"
	Any GPIO pin on the ESP32-WROOM module can function as a digital I/O *(input or output)*. However, users will need to declare the [**`pinMode()`** *(link)*](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/digital-io/pinmode/) in the setup of their <b>sketch</b> (programs written in the Arduino IDE) to configure a pin as an input or an output.

	<div class="grid cards col-2" markdown>

	-   **Inputs**

		---

		When configured properly, an <b>input</b> pin will be looking for a <b>HIGH</b> or <b>LOW</b> state. <b>Input</b> pins are <b>High Impedance</b> and takes very little current to move the input pin from one state to another.

		<center>

		| **`DIAG` *(TMC6300)*** | `GPIO 34` |
		| :--------------------- | :-------- |
		| **`INT` *(TMAG5273)*** | `GPIO 04` |
		| **Button ++"13"++**    | `GPIO 13` |
		| **Button ++"14"++**    | `GPIO 14` |

		</center>

	-   **Outputs**

		---

		When configured as an <b>output</b> the pin will be at a <b>HIGH</b> or <b>LOW</b> voltage. <b>Output</b> pins are <b>Low Impedance</b>: This means that they can provide a relatively substantial amount of current to other circuits.

		<center>

		| **`VIO` *(TMC6300)*** | `GPIO 05` |
		| :-------------------- | :-------- |
		| **WS2812**            | `GPIO 02` |

		</center>

		!!! warning
			**&#9889;** There are electrical limitations to the amount of current that the ESP32-WROOM module can sink or source. For more details, check out the <a href="./assets/component_documentation/esp32-wroom-32e_datasheet_en.pdf">ESP32-WROOM module datasheet</a>.

	</div>

	!!! tip
		Pins cannot be configured to operate simultaneously as an input and output, without implementing the pin as an interrupt.


=== "Analog Inputs"
	The ESP32-WROOM module provides a <b>12-bit ADC</b> input on thirteen of its I/O pins. This functionality is accessed in the Arduino IDE using the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/analog-io/analogread/">`analogRead(pin)` function</a>. *(The available ADC pins are highlighted in the image below.)*


	<center>

	| **Current Sensor** | INA240 *(`U`)* | INA240 *(`V`)* | INA240 *(`W`)* | MCP6021   |
	| :----------------- | :------------: | :------------: | :------------: | :-------: |
	| **Analog Input**   | `GPIO 35`      | `GPIO 36`      | `GPIO 39`      | `GPIO 32` |
	
	</center>


	!!! info
		By default, in the Arduino IDE, `analogRead()` returns a 10-bit value. To change the resolution of the value returned by the `analogRead()` function, use the [`analogReadResolution(bits)` function](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/zero-due-mkr-family/analogreadresolution/).

=== "Serial Pins"
	The ESP32-WROOM module provides three UART ports. By default, the UART port for the USB connection (`Serial`) and the labeled UART I/O pins on the board (`Serial1`) can be accessed through the Arduino IDE using the [serial communication class](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/serial/).

	!!! info
		By default, in the Arduino IDE, the **<Dev Board Name>** board definition supports:		

		* `Serial` - **UART (USB)**
		* `Serial1` - **Pins: `RX`/`TX` (`GPIO 16`/`GPIO 17`)**

		??? note
			* The `GPIO 16` and `GPIO 17` pins of `Serial1` are already dedicated to the `UH`/`UL` half-bridge on the TMC63000 motor driver and are not broken out for users to access.
			* In order to utilize the serial communication on the strapping pins, users will need to create a custom serial port object and declare which pins to access.

			**Serial Communication**</a>

		</div>


	!!! tip
		We have noticed that with the ESP32 Arduino core, `Serial.available()` does not operate instantaneously. This is due to an interrupt triggered by the UART, to empty the FIFO when the <b>`RX`</b> pin is inactive for two byte periods:

		* At 9600 baud, `hwAvailable` takes [`number of bytes received` + 2] x 1 ms = <b>11 ms</b> before the UART indicates that data was received from: `\r\nERROR\r\n`.
		* At 115200 baud, `hwAvailable` takes [`number of bytes received` + 2] x .087 ms = <b>~1 ms</b> before the UART indicates that data was received from: `\r\nERROR\r\n`.

		*For more information, please refer to this [chatroom discussion](https://gitter.im/espressif/arduino-esp32?at=5e25d6370a1cf54144909c85).*


=== "SPI Pins"
	The ESP32-WROOM module provides three SPI buses. By default, in the Arduino IDE, the [SPI class](https://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/SPI) is configured to utilize pins `GPIO 18` *(SCK)*, `GPIO 19` *(POCI)*, `GPIO 23` *(PICO)*. In order to utilize the other SPI ports or objects, users will need to create a custom SPI object and declare which pins to access.
	
	!!! info
		To comply with the latest [OSHW](https://www.oshwa.org/) design practices, we have [adopted the new SPI signal nomenclature](https://www.sparkfun.com/spi_signal_names) (**SDO**/**SDI** and **PICO**/**POCI**). The terms Master and Slave are now referred to as Controller and Peripheral. The `MOSI` signal on a controller has been replaced with `SDO` or `PICO`. Please refer to this [announcement on the decision to deprecate the **MOSI**/**MISO** terminology and transition to the **SDO**/**SDI** naming convention](https://www.oshwa.org/a-resolution-to-redefine-spi-signal-names).
	
	<center>

	| **SCK**             | `GPIO 18` (`SCK`)  |
	| :------------------ | :----------------- |
	| **SDI** or **POCI** | `GPIO 19` (`MISO`) |
	| **SDO** or **PICO** | `GPIO 23` (`MOSI`) |
	| **CS**              | `GPIO 5` (`SS`)    |

	</center>

	??? note
		* The `GPIO 18`,`GPIO 19`, and `GPIO 23` pins of the `SPI` bus are already dedicated to the `VH`/`WH`/`VL` MOSFETs on the TMC63000 motor driver and are not broken out for users to access.
		* The `CS` pin associated with `GPIO 05` is also already dedicated to the `STBY` pin of the TMC63000 motor driver and is not broken out for users to access.

### Half-Bridges

The TMC6300 features high-side and low-side MOSFET pairs of the three available half-bridges which control the commutation of the three motor phases.

</figcaption>
</figure>

=== "Input"
	The electronic commutation sequence for these MOSFETs will depend on the motor that is connected. For most cases, users will provide a PWM signal to each of these pins. *These are active-high pins.*

	| ESP32-WROOM  | `16` | `17` | `18` | `23` | `19` | `33` |
	| :----------- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
	| Motor Driver | `UH` | `UL` | `VH` | `VL` | `WH` | `WL` |

	</center>

	??? info "Active High"
		By pulling the pin high, the MOSFET will enable power to flow through that section of the half-bridge.


=== "Output"
	With the electronic commutation sequence provided to the half-bridges, the output motor phases will drive a connected motor.

	</figure>


#### Motor Commutation

The TMC6300 relies on an electrical [commutation](https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/865.21/topics/power_electronics/commutation/#bldc-commutation) sequence/signal to drive the motor phases to a [BLDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushless_DC_electric_motor "brushless DC") or [PMSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_motor#Permanent-magnet "permanent magnet synchronous motor") motor. The commutation signals for these motors are trapezoidal for BLDC motors and sinusoidal for PMSM motors.

</center>


!!! tip "Gimbal Motor"
	Based on measuring the output from one of the coils, our gimbal motor is a PMSM and would require a sinusoidal waveform to drive the motor. It should be noted that a trapezodial waveform can probably be used; however, users may notice effects such as cogging.

	<figure markdown>

	Sinusoidal PWM signal.<br>
	(Source: [Demystifying BLDC motor commutation: Trap, Sine, & FOC](https://www.ti.com/lit/ml/slyp711/slyp711.pdf))
	</figcaption>
	</figure>

	For a trapezoidal signal, the high-side (HS) and low-side (LS) MOSFETs, can just be driven high or low. However, in order to approximate a sinusoidal signal, a progressively varying PWM signal must be provided with all six signals in sync with each other.



### `VIO`/Standby Pin

In it's default configuration, the `VIO` pin is used to enable the motor driver and set the logic level voltage of the TMC6300 inputs. However, the `VIO` pin also operates as a standby pin when it is pulled `LOW`. In standby, the TMC6300 resets and sits in standby mode.

Users can control the `VIO` pin with `GPIO 05` on the ESP32-WROOM module, to reset the TMC6300 or put it in standby mode.


### Diagnostic Pin

The diagnostic pin is triggered based on different faults *(i.e. shorts and overtemperature)* detected by the IC. By default, the status will be indicated by the, green diagnostic, `DIAG` LED and will remail `LOW` until triggered. Once triggered, users will need to disable and reset the TMC6300 or power cycle the board.

Users can monitor the diagnostic pin with `GPIO 34` on the ESP32-WROOM module, to determine if the TMC6300 need to be reset to clear a fault.


### Current Sense Pin
The current sense pin is the foot point of the `U` and `V` half-bridges, with a 0.12&ohm; resistor attached. Users can measure the voltage across the resistor to determine the current flowing to the motor *(see the **[Low-side Op Amp - MCP6021](#low-side-op-amp-mcp6021)** section below)*.

!!! info
	For more details, please refer to the [TMAG5273 datasheet](./assets/component_documentation/TMAG5273.pdf).


### Interrupt Pin

The interrupt pin of the TMAG5723 can be configured in different modes to utilize either the `INT` or `SCL` pins.

* No interrupt
* Interrupt through `INT`
* Interrupt through `INT` except when I2C busy
* Interrupt through `SCL`
* Interrupt through `SCL` except when I2C busy

!!! tip
	We recommend utilizing the default `INT` pin to trigger interrupts; as it is already connected to `GPIO 04` of the ESP32-WROOM module.

	??? warning "Bus Contention"
		Texas Instruments does not recommend sharing the I<sup>2</sup>C bus with multiple devices when using the `SCL` pin for the interrupt function. The `SCL` interrupt can potentially corrupt the transactions with other devices, when present on the same I<sup>2</sup>C bus.

!!! note
	The TMAG5273 is programmed to detect a magnetic threshold in wake-up or sleep mode. Once the magnetic threshold cross is detected, the device asserts a latched interrupt signal through the INT pin, and goes back to stand-by mode. The interrupt latch is cleared through the `SCL` pin.


## Current Sensors
There are two different types of Op Amps on the board to amplify the input voltage for the current measurements.

* The INA240 is used for the in-line current measurements between the TMC6300 and the gimabal motor.
* The MCP6021 is used on the low-side current measurement of the TMC63000's half-bridges.
