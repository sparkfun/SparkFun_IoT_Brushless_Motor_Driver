[*SparkFun IoT Brushless Motor Driver (ESP32 WROOM, TMC6300) (ROB-22132)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/22132)

The SparkFun IoT Brushless Motor Driver is an all-in-one development platform. It includes all the components to create a simple IoT device or learn about [control systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_system). On the boaard, users will find an ESP32 microcontroller, a TMC6300 motor driver, a [gimbal motor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/20441), a TMAG5273 hall-effect sensor, three INA240A1 inline current sensors, an MCP6021T low-side current sensor, two user buttons, a Qwiic connector, a 3-pin JST connector (for the gimbal motor), and a WS2812 RGB LED.

The TMC6300 from [ADI + Trinamic](https://www.trinamic.com/) is a powerful and easy-to-use three-phase motor driver with up to 2A (1.4A<sub>RMS</sub>) of total drive current. Separate high-side and low-side control of the three half-bridges allows for incredible control of each phase of the [motor commutation](https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/865.21/topics/power_electronics/commutation/#bldc-commutation). We've found the [*Arduino Simple Field Oriented Control*](https://docs.simplefoc.com/) library to work well with the TMC6300 motor driver.

However, a field-oriented control (FOC) algorithm requires some feedback to close and optimize the control loop. Therefore, we integrated a TMAG5273 hall-effect sensor and INA240A1 current sensor amplifiers *(both manufactured by [Texas Instruments](https://www.ti.com/))* into the design of the IoT motor driver board. This allows users to incorporate a [position sensor](https://docs.simplefoc.com/position_sensors) and [current sensing](https://docs.simplefoc.com/current_sense) into the FOC algorithm or any feedback control loop they choose to implement.
